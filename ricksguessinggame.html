      <p> My programming journey began in junior high, shadowing web developers and attempting to create pages based on my favorite sports teams. In high school I took a programming class where we developed freestyle games of our choosing, incorporating as many elements as we were willing to learn. I strayed away from coding for a while, but I am finally ready to go all in now.</p>

      <p><strong>In this game, you will be asked a series of questions. The more questions you get right, the higher your score (and prize) will be! Are you ready?</strong></p>

    /* So this is like, my first legit JavaScript program.
   It collects data in the form of the player's name, and asks
   a series of questions about me! The program keeps track of the
   player's score along the way and at the end, if the score is "good"
   enough, the player receives a star! But the type of star (gold, silver,
   or bronze) depends on the player's score. Enjoy!*/
